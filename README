This is a copy of original Color Sampler Pack from vim.org website:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=625

I created github version so that it can be used conveniently with Vundle :)


PREREQUISITES
-------------
You need to have Vundle plugin installed:
https://github.com/gmarik/vundle


INSTALL VIM-THEME-PACK
----------------------
1. Add following line to your .vimrc:
Bundle 'bzx/vim-theme-pack'

2. Run this command:
:BundleInstall

..and you should be all set!


MORE INFO
---------
Please note that the original Color Sampler Pack from vim.org is also included in the Janus plugin for vim (https://github.com/carlhuda/janus). I found Janus package to have too many plugins installed and wanted to create a nice and clean installation of the stuff I need. Vundle allows to do such things in a very simple way.

I am using MacVim 7.3 (53).

Here's the excerpt from my .vimrc showing what plugins I use:

Bundle 'wycats/nerdtree'
Bundle 'msanders/snipmate.vim'
Bundle 'ervandew/supertab'
Bundle 'scrooloose/syntastic'
Bundle 'altercation/vim-colors-solarized'
Bundle 'pangloss/vim-javascript'
Bundle 'tpope/vim-surround'
Bundle 'bzx/vim-theme-pack'
Bundle 'guns/Command-T'
Bundle 'sukima/xmledit'
Bundle 'vim-scripts/bufkill.vim'

(I will probably give up on NERDtree in favor of Command-T).
